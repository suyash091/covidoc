 # covidoc

This is a community sponsored web app, made for combating the situation arised due to spread of Novel Corona Virus, also known as Covid-19. This complete web app is of the community, made for the community, by the community. Any one is free to suggest a feature, open an issue or request changes in the app, moreover you are also free to fork our codebase and work on a feature or suggest inclusion of your work in the main branch. If you are willing to contribute with your skill, you can check issues opened on github.
Many apps already exists related to covid-19, but there were certain drawbacks:
One section of apps are related to diagnosis of covid-19, many good apps exist from the known names in the industry and establish brands but apart from them others are mere copy paste of 3 symptomatic questions related to cough, cold and fever other than that they don't offer any deeper insight although WHO has already laid well estalished guidelines which they update on regular basis in the view of changing circumstances. Many such apps recieved widespread criticism for not having any quality standards in place related to screening of patient. 
further other drawbacks are they serve no other purpose than mere symptom screening, which we already know so far, they don't look into your past history of medical records and neither take demographic factors into account on top of that authenticty and following of standards protocol was widespread criticised on professional platform such as Linkedin.
Another section of apps are related to tracking the status of covid-19, however these app serve a mere purpose of being a scorecard and instead of warning people of developing circumstances they create unnecessary panic. In this situtation, it required that an app should focus on analysing the local trends and throw some insight on the precaution to be taken. We have a widespread data of worldwide Covid pandemic breaks which can be leveraged for the same. 
Some apps do try to leverage the potential of Data Science but majority of these work was criticised by people of epidemiologist and doctors background for lack of citation, not folowing industry standards and lacking quality and hence many people had to make an apology on public domain, one such event happened with an author at pyimageSearch. Later they all started to also take disclaimer section in account. One such flaw in majority of apps are, not citing the data, making huge forecast about positive cases or death which caused controversy and in X-ray analysis, majority of work revolves around only two categories covid positive or negative, hence a person suffering from other viral disease may get classified wrong or they may confuse patient if they have other viral disease along with symptoms and there model fails to answer them.
Only one app is there which tries to throw an insight on warning a user about situation around him and that is the official government app, but we believe this app too has cohorent flaws, first of all that misrepresent itself and people often believe it is a warning system. However this confusion must be clarified, this app do not warns you if you are in situation of having corona, it is only after you may have been affected with covid-19 then it will warn you of the possibility. It relies on tracking all the users and if anyone of them is found to be covid-19 positive than tracing all his contacts. It is a mere app aimed to track people they have to quarantine. But if some changes are done, instead of serving a mere isolating platform it can warn user about the situation around him and truly personalised for him.
#our app
Keeping all the drawbacks in mind, addinf
First of all we serve as your one stop place for all your covid queries, be it tracking the current status, knowledge mining, forecasting, diagnostic or screening needs, a tool which allow you for deeper analysis and insight on the developing situation, a truely customized experience tailored for you, contant new feature updates, powered by carefully curated machine learning and deep learning architecture. We will try to pin down and customize things as much as possible for each individual person on our platform. We aim to take every factor into account for generating a personalised report for you powered by state of the art advancement in machine learning. We also aim to cite research paper for every feature, follow and update our platform dynamically according to WHO guideline and make it available on public platform, we cite every peice of data being used on our platform from images to patient record, our infrastructure is highly scalable powered by google cloud platform. Every tool on the platform is indegenious and we emphasized and relied more on custom solutions and very less on third party libraries. This makes our platform, completely custom so offers more adaptibility and can accomodate more changes. Apart from necessary citing of data, we are also proposing a paper for every feature to add authenticity on top of already highly credible app. Our app is an outcome of standard Data Science application based on rigorous medical validation. We have cited the source where ever it was possible and already proposed papers at different places for review.

A chatbot on our app sucessfully implement the latest WHO guidelines and dynamically updates itself in background upon any new updates from WHO and the flow chart of built around guidlines is made avalable and updated at <IMAGE LINK>.
A Screening Questionaire which is curated by a Doctor, implemented by a Data Scientist and prepared based on results and finding of a research done at Wuhan college and institute.
X-ray tool, based on recommendation and collecting critical comments of certain doctors on other people who implemented the tool we cited the sources of every single image used in the platform, employed latest state of the art model as opposed to commonly used variants of resnet, implemented seperate category for other diseases instead of keeping just positive or negative category. Even after inclusion of all the recommendation and suggestion, we buy no mean suggest it to be used for clinical purpose, only for first hand idea of the same, However if proper data is provided to us we may develop a model for which we can take 100% responsibility for.
As opposed to just, number of cases, we provide deeper insight on current covid situtation that may matter to you. instead of reporting only deceased, recovered or hospitalised data. We also compare total number of beds in your state in regards of active admitted patients.
