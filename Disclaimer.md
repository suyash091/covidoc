This is a community sponsored web app, made for combating the situation arose due to the spread of novel corona virus, also known as COVID-19. This complete web app is made for the community, and anyone can suggest a feature, open an issue or request changes in the app for better optimization. Moreover, anyone is also free to fork our codebase and work on a feature or suggest inclusion of your work in the main branch. If you are willing to contribute with your skill, you can check issues opened on GitHub.

Many apps already exist currently related to COVID-19, but there were certain drawbacks in many of them. Some of those drawbacks were:

1.	One section of such apps is generally designed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and many of these are planned and promoted by established brand names and recognised authorities. However, apart from these, other apps circulating in the market are mere copy paste of 3 symptomatic questions related to cough, cold and fever and other than those they don't offer any deeper insight, in spite of the fact that WHO has already laid out well established guidelines which they update on a regular basis with context to the changing circumstances. Many such apps have received widespread criticism for not having any quality standards in place required for proper screening of a screening of patient. 
2.	Another drawback is that such apps are not able to serve any other purpose than mere symptom screening, which we already know so far, and they don’t also provide a feature for looking into your past history of medical records and neither do they take one’s demographic factors into account. In addition to that, their authenticity and use of standard protocols was widespread criticised on professional platform such as LinkedIn.
3.	Another section of the circulating COVID-19 apps is related to tracking of the number of patients infected with COVID-19, however these apps serve a mere purpose of being a scorecard and instead of warning people of developing circumstances they create unnecessary panic. Instead, in such a situation, it is required that an app should focus on analysing the local trends and throwing some insight on the precautions which need to be taken. We have a widespread data of worldwide COVID-19 pandemic breaks which can be leveraged for the same. 
4.	Some apps have also tried to leverage the power of data science but the work of majority of such apps has been criticised by people from epidemiological and medical background for lack of citations, not following industry standards and lacking quality measures. Hence, many people had to make an apology on a public domain and one such event also happened with an author at PyImageSearch. Therefore, later they all started to take disclaimer section also in account. Some of the flaws in majority of these apps are, not citing the data properly, making huge forecast about the number of positive cases or deaths, which caused a lot of controversy. In X-ray analysis also, majority of their work revolves around only two categories: COVID-19 positive or negative, because of which a person suffering from other viral disease may get wrongly classified and it may confuse a patient if they are suffering from other viral disease along with COVID-19 symptoms. Such questions were the ones on which their model failed.
5.	Currently, only one app is there which tries to throw an insight or warning to a user about the prevailing situation around him and that is the official government app. However, we believe this app too has its own coherent flaws, such as its glitch of misrepresenting itself sometimes, making people view it as a warning system. However, this confusion needs be clarified, as this app does not warns a user if he/she is in a situation of contracting the corona virus, but it is only after he/she may have been affected with COVID-19, after which it will warn them of the possibility. It relies on a tracking mechanism of all its users and if anyone of them is found to be COVID-19 positive then it starts tracing all his/her contacts. It is an app which is aimed to track the COVID-19 positive cases so that they can be quarantined. The tool, however, can be made more functional by adding more feature which can warn a user about his current neighbourhood and make it personalised for him/her. 

Our app is designed and curated keeping all the above mentioned drawbacks in mind. 

1.	Firstly, we model as a one stop destination for all your COVID-19 apprehensions and queries, be it live tracking of the current status, knowledge mining, forecasting, enhancing the current diagnostic or screening models, and providing results as per the WHO guidelines.
2.	It is a tool which allows a user to gain deeper analysis and insight on the developing situation and have a customized experience tailored for him/her, along with consistently providing new feature updates, powered by carefully curated machine learning and deep learning architecture. 
3.	We have tried to pin down and customize things as much as possible for each individual on our platform and aim to continue doing so as the number of users increase and also try to take every factor into account for generating a personalised report for you, powered by the state of the art advancement in machine learning. We also aim to cite the research papers referred to for every feature, and follow and update our platform dynamically according to WHO guideline, along with making the same available on public platform.
4.	We have also cited every piece of data that has been used on our platform like the images, videos, databases and patient records and our infrastructure too is highly scalable powered by the Google Cloud platform. Every tool on the platform is indigenous and we have emphasized and relied more on custom solutions and lesser on third party libraries. This makes our platform, completely customised because of which it offers more adaptability and can accommodate more changes. 
5.	Apart from the necessary citing of data, we have also proposed a paper for every feature, which will add authenticity on top of our already highly credible app. Our app is an outcome of a standard data science application based on rigorous medical validation. We have cited the source where ever it was necessary and already proposed papers at different places for review.

Some of the currently available features on our app are -

A chatbot on our app, which has been successfully implemented based on the latest WHO guidelines and dynamically updates itself in background upon any new updates that comes from WHO and the flow chart of the built around guidelines is also made available and updated at <IMAGE LINK>.
A screening questionnaire which has been curated by a doctor, implemented by a data scientist and prepared based on the results and finding of a research done at the Wuhan college and institute.
An X-ray tool, based on the recommendations of medical professionals and critical comments of certain doctors on other people who implemented similar tools like this. We have cited the sources of every single image used on the platform, employed latest state of the art model as opposed to the commonly used variants of ResNet, and implemented separate categories for other diseases instead of keeping just a positive or a negative category. Even after the inclusion of all the recommendations and suggestions, we by no means suggest that it should be used for clinical purpose but only for first hand idea of the same. However, if proper data is provided to us, we may develop a model for which we can take 100% responsibility for.
  
As opposed to merely providing a count of the number of positive cases, we provide deeper insights on the current COVID-19 situation that may matter to you. instead of reporting only the deceased, recovered or hospitalised data, we have also compared the total number of beds in a state as compared to the active admitted patients.

Although we have carefully abided by all the rules, regulations and standard criteria for the development of this app, since it is a community sponsored tool, we hold no responsibility for any un-factored, unforeseen or unaccounted issues caused by this app, even though the chances of such a damage caused is close to zero or negligible.

We are also open for contributions and collaborations in any kind, be it from skill, expertise, knowledge, experience to donations, honestly updating your information and sharing our platform. We also plan to reward active contributors and include them in our hall of fame for helping us in this battle against COVID-19.

We believe that if we all fight this battle together, with proper awareness which can be created by proper tools such as ours, we can effectively defeat COVID-19 and remain safe and healthy. By agreeing to our terms and condition, you allow us to use your non personal data for machine learning and training purposes. We do not store or use any personal data other than email (for identifying fraud and flagging spam in our training algorithm) as opposed to other apps and rely on honest and active usage of our platform. 
This app is developed and curated by researchers, professors, medical professionals and a team of data scientists with a strong industrial experience of applied machine learning in medical domain.

By agreeing to our terms of usage, you agree that we hold no responsibility of any damage caused by this app to you and allow us to use your non-personal and medical footprints to track the current situation, train the required AI models and help different visualisation on our platform. By agreeing to do so, and by being honest in your usage, you will help us in providing this nation an effective tool to combat COVID-19 during its third stage. For more information about the amazing upcoming features that can help you in your fight against the novel corona virus, please head forward to the roadmap section on next screen.

Our app is powered by the Google Cloud Platform and has a highly customized and precisely prepared architecture which makes it a highly scalable platform. This incurs heavy expenses which we are bearing on our own so please proceed to our support us section in our app. Every contribution of any kind will strengthen our #WarOnCovid, so please share our app with a hashtag #waroncovid to show us your love and support.

We believe that only if India stands against the corona virus together and all its citizens pledge to stay strong in unity, we can come out of this pandemic together safer and stronger!! It’s our first step to democratize AI and make AI available for all.
